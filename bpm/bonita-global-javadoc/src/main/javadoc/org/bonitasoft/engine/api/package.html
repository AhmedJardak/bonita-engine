    <p>
    	Main <b>Community Edition</b> package to access Community APIs. If you have a Subscription license, please use
    	{@link com.bonitasoft.engine.api} package that gives full access to all Subscription features.
    	<br />
    	Please keep in mind that <b>org</b>.bonitasoft.engine.* packages are for Community and Subscription developers, and <b>com</b>.bonitasoft.engine.* packages are
    	for Subscription developers only.
    	<br />
        The Bonita BPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual implementation classes.
        <br />
        The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
        <br />
        Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in the future.
