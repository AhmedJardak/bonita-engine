    <p>
    	Main <b>Subscription Edition</b> package to access Subscription APIs. If you don't have a Subscription license but only run a Community Edition, please use
    	{@link org.bonitasoft.engine.api} package.
    	<br />
    	Please keep in mind that <code><b>org</b>.bonitasoft.engine.*</code> packages are for Community and Subscription developers, and <code><b>com</b>.bonitasoft.engine.*</code> packages are
    	for Subscription developers only.
    	<br />
        The Bonita BPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual implementation classes.
        <br />
        The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
        <br />
        Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in the future.
